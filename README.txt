Simple telegram bot that finds you this weeks food at the univeristy of Zurich cafeterias
Tried to make the bot respond do swiss-german since this is the language we write each other
and wanted to make communicating with the bot feel like talking to a person
To use the bot, go to Telegram and search for "UZHFoodBot". Start a new Chat with him.
The interaction should be explained properly in the beginning.

Just write the bot swissgerman statements that have the form "cafeteriaName weekday/when" like "Benz öbermorn" or "Irchel hött"
and the bot will respond with a detailed menu plan. 

Note that the bot server is not always online since I am currently setting up a raspberry pi
that will run the python bot on a linux server, but yet it is just running on my laptop over the days.
